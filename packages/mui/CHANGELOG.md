# @meonode/mui

## 2.0.0-beta.0

### Patch Changes

- [#7](https://github.com/l7aromeo/meonode/pull/7) [`dbe025a`](https://github.com/l7aromeo/meonode/commit/dbe025a6f125f48337f5780a7e65c068c4145c72) Thanks [@l7aromeo](https://github.com/l7aromeo)! - Point `homepage` and the README at the documentation site.

  Both packages sent readers to their GitHub folder instead of the docs.
  `@meonode/ui` already links to `ui.meonode.com`, so these were the two
  outliers, and npm package pages are among the strongest signals pointing
  at the docs domain — which Google currently reports as 0 indexed pages,
  19 not indexed, with the whole site sitting in "Crawled - currently not
  indexed" three months after the domain move.

  `homepage` now deep-links to each package's own page —
  `/docs/mui-integration` and `/docs/getting-started/compiler` — and both
  READMEs carry a Documentation link near the top, where npm renders it.

## 1.5.11

### Patch Changes

- [#1](https://github.com/l7aromeo/meonode/pull/1) [`5d234ac`](https://github.com/l7aromeo/meonode/commit/5d234acb9d15dc77de33eff8624d5eb9a2622e37) Thanks [@l7aromeo](https://github.com/l7aromeo)! - Point the package metadata at the new monorepo. `repository`, `bugs` and `homepage` referenced the three separate repositories that have now been merged into [l7aromeo/meonode](https://github.com/l7aromeo/meonode), and each package gains a `repository.directory` so npm links to its own subtree. No functional change — npm reads these fields from the published tarball, so a release is the only way to correct them.
